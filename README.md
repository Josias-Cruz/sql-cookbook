# SQL Cookbook  

# Background

This SQL guide is written in the context of a cookbook or recipe book if you will. I will be breaking down SQL in a way that it's like following a recipe. I'll be exploring different usecases as a dish comparison and dissecting them into their ingredients and preparations/usecases. I decided to write this guide in that way due to my background in cooking, and also found that a lot of the SQL guides are a bit lacking in business context and uniforming it with the technical aspects of SQL. While none of the techniques/thoughts are anything new, they're organized in a way that for me, and hopefully for you, they're easier to digest and understand in a creative way. 

I'll be structuring the book in the following way. First, we'll go into the forray of the different types of commands in SQL, then a few exploratory queries that we can use as building blocks to more complex queries and sooner or later we'll be pumping queries fit for holiday meals, full spreads of data. This is a living document and will be recieving update sporadically. If there's a topic you'd like to be covered drop an issue and I will try to incorporate it into the guide.
